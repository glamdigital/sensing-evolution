Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.40,0:00:04.35,Default,,0,0,0,,The Snowy Owl has incredible hearing and eyesight
Dialogue: 0,0:00:04.38,0:00:08.75,Default,,0,0,0,,near silent flight, feathered talons, and of course it's white.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.83,0:00:13.92,Default,,0,0,0,,These are all incredibly valuable features for an Arctic predator.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.92,0:00:20.76,Default,,0,0,0,,And they're the result of natural selection acting on countless generations of Snowy Owls.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.07,0:00:26.01,Default,,0,0,0,,Parents with characteristics which helped them survive and reproduce
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.01,0:00:30.56,Default,,0,0,0,,would be most likely to pass on those characteristics to their offspring.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.89,0:00:36.03,Default,,0,0,0,,We think that natural selection is even acting on the size of the Snowy Owl as well,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.03,0:00:39.88,Default,,0,0,0,,because average sized owls tend to have the most offspring.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.88,0:00:42.57,Default,,0,0,0,,This might all be about energy.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.57,0:00:49.29,Default,,0,0,0,,Larger owls might have too much of an energy demand to have plenty of offspring.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.29,0:00:53.24,Default,,0,0,0,,Smaller owls might not get enough larger prey
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.53,0:00:58.88,Default,,0,0,0,,and so natural selection favours an optimum body weight
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.02,0:01:01.96,Default,,0,0,0,,where more offspring will be produced.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.29,0:01:13.53,Default,,0,0,0,,and we see a wonderful range of animals adapted to all sorts of different environments.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.63,0:01:18.24,Default,,0,0,0,,And of course, natural selection and evolution is still happening.
