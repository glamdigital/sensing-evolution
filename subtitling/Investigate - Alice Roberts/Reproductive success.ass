Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.78,0:00:04.79,Default,,0,0,0,,Reproduction is key to the survival of any species.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.20,0:00:10.32,Default,,0,0,0,,Even amongst mammals, we find differences in reproductive strategies.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.32,0:00:14.49,Default,,0,0,0,,Some species like us humans tend to have just a few offspring
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.49,0:00:16.49,Default,,0,0,0,,and we look after them very carefully
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.90,0:00:20.20,Default,,0,0,0,,and this improves their chances of surviving to adulthood.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.81,0:00:23.51,Default,,0,0,0,,Other species have a very different strategy
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.92,0:00:26.24,Default,,0,0,0,,and they have many, many offspring
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.40,0:00:28.98,Default,,0,0,0,,A really good example of that is the shrew
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.98,0:00:33.12,Default,,0,0,0,,A female shrew has between 15 and 28 offspring
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.12,0:00:35.12,Default,,0,0,0,,in every breeding season.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.84,0:00:39.64,Default,,0,0,0,,In every single litter, there is going to be variation.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.64,0:00:43.08,Default,,0,0,0,,Those offspring are going to differ from each other.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.40,0:00:48.12,Default,,0,0,0,,Some individuals are going to be better suited to the environment that they're born into
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.30,0:00:50.61,Default,,0,0,0,,and they'll have a better chance of survival.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.04,0:00:54.44,Default,,0,0,0,,So this is what's known as "survival of the fittest".
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.80,0:00:57.08,Default,,0,0,0,,But natural selection doesn't stop there.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.08,0:01:02.60,Default,,0,0,0,,Because even amongst the shrews that survive to adulthood, there will be varying numbers of offspring.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.60,0:01:10.36,Default,,0,0,0,,So natural selection is actually about survival <i><b>and</i></b> reproduction.
