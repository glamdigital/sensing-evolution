Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.32,0:00:03.16,Default,,0,0,0,,Charles Darwin is famous for his theory of evolution.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.16,0:00:09.44,Default,,0,0,0,,Evolution explains how plants and animals slowly change over long periods of time into new species.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.44,0:00:13.60,Default,,0,0,0,,It's a clever and complicated idea that Darwin worked on for many years.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.76,0:00:16.68,Default,,0,0,0,,But what does it have to do with these pigeons?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.68,0:00:24.20,Default,,0,0,0,,You've just seen how small variations between animals of the same species might make one animal more likely to survive than another.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.36,0:00:27.98,Default,,0,0,0,,That animal may pass on its characteristics to its young.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.08,0:00:31.58,Default,,0,0,0,,However, if an animal doesn't survive long enough to have babies,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.58,0:00:35.02,Default,,0,0,0,,those characteristics could be lost from the species altogether.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.06,0:00:38.44,Default,,0,0,0,,This happens in nature, but people can make it happen too.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.44,0:00:43.88,Default,,0,0,0,,If you kept and bred pigeons and only allowed the ones with speckled wings to have babies,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.88,0:00:47.94,Default,,0,0,0,,you'd be much more likely to have pigeon babies with speckled wings.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.94,0:00:52.56,Default,,0,0,0,,If you kept on doing this, eventually all of your pigeons would be speckled.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.06,0:00:55.16,Default,,0,0,0,,Darwin did this with his own pigeons
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.16,0:01:00.76,Default,,0,0,0,,He realised that while some species will have characteristics which are passed on or disappear in nature,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.88,0:01:04.36,Default,,0,0,0,,species will change very slowly and with time
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.10,0:01:10.74,Default,,0,0,0,,This is all because small variations can change an animal's chances of passing on its characteristics.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.74,0:01:13.24,Default,,0,0,0,,This, he called 'natural selection'.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.24,0:01:15.24,Default,,0,0,0,,
