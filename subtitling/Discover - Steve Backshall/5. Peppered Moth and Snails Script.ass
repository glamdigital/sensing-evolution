Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.88,0:00:08.64,Default,,0,0,0,,but we also know that we belong to just one species. Humans, or '{\i1}Homo sapiens{\i0}'
Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.84,0:00:13.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Animals of the same species may look similar, but not identical to each other
Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.06,0:00:16.02,Default,,0,0,0,,There are always going to be differences in size, shape,

Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.66,0:00:24.72,Default,,0,0,0,,This display behind me has a variety of different colours of moths and snails,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.76,0:00:28.78,Default,,0,0,0,,but there's only {\i1}one{\i0} species of snail, and {\i1}one{\i0} species of moth here.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.86,0:00:37.54,Default,,0,0,0,,and sometimes a variation can help one animal to survive better than another.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.94,0:00:43.76,Default,,0,0,0,,Stronger legs, better eyesight, or better camouflage, such as is found in the moths here

Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.24,0:00:48.24,Default,,0,0,0,,and here's the crucial bit -
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.24,0:00:54.22,Default,,0,0,0,,An animal that survives and has babies, can pass on its features or its characteristics to its young.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.30,0:00:59.18,Default,,0,0,0,,In just the same way as you'll have some characteristics you've inherited from your parents.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.18,0:01:04.48,Default,,0,0,0,,An animal that has an unlucky variation, won't be able to survive and have babies at all,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.48,0:01:07.38,Default,,0,0,0,,so it won't pass on any of its characteristics.
